<h6> A NEW ERA OF AI
    There are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI.
     The first is the most universal interface: natural language.
      The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive 
      human-computer interfaces—keyboards, mice, touch screens.
     We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—natural language—and will quickly go beyond,
      to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around us.</h6>
